# skin_analysis
### Dataset
We have used [HAM10000 dataset].The HAM10000 dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which are released as a training set for academic machine learning purposes and are publicly available through the ISIC archive.

It has 7 different classes of skin cancer which are listed below :

1. Melanocytic nevi
2. Melanoma
3. Benign keratosis-like lesions
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Actinic keratoses
6. Vascular lesions
7. Dermatofibroma

In this kernel 7 different classes of skin cancer will be classified using MobileNet Network with keras tensorflow in backend with Exploratory Data Analysis. The steps followed for model building and evaluation can be structured as follows :

Step 1: Importing Essential Libraries <br>
Step 2: Reading and Processing Data <br>
Step 3: Data Cleaning <br>
Step 4: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) <br>
Step 5: Train Validation Split <br>
Step 6: Image Augmentation <br>
Step 7: Model Building (MobileNet) <br>
Step 8: Training the model <br>
Step 9: Model Evaluation <br>
